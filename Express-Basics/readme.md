# Learning Express
### About 
This Node app is a bot that writes to a JSON file, in this case the 'words' file, and uses Express to give users the data from JSON
when the port is connected to. 

### Known Bug
When users connect to the server they are only show the original contents of the JSON file and not the modified content that is written to
the file after the script runs.
