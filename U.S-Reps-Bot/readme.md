# Jos U.S Reps Bot 
### About 
This program is the first part of a larger project to bring awareness to people's local government representation.
This simple web applet will read a users address and give them information 
about who their local representatives are. In the future I hope to parse more data from this API to demonstrate
location data on these representatives, committees that they're a part of and more useful data the should be 
more readily available and accessible.
